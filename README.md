## MVP/ Post MVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.
#### MVP
- Research API that can provide the infromations that I needed to include in my web app.
- Start creating the base of my web app and try putting a face that I am visuallizing for it
- Start working on the functionality and clickable events on it.
- Add more CSS advanced styling

#### Post MVP
These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|

|FEB| Core Application Structure (React, Ruby, CSS etc.) | complete
|FEB| Initial Clickable Model  | complete

## Priority Matrix

## Timeframes
Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
